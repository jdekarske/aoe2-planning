OPTIC
-----

This package contains OPTIC, a planner for use in problems where plan cost is
determined by preferences or time-dependent goal-collection costs.  For more
details, see the paper "Temporal Planning with Preferences and Time-Dependent 
Continuous Costs", J. Benton, A. J. Coles, and A. I. Coles, ICAPS 2012.

Build
-----

This distribution contains precompiled object files for OPTIC, and precompiled
static libraries for the CBC MIP solver.  As the licence applied to CBC is
incompatible with the GPL, you must type:

make

...to link them together, producing optic-clp.

Note that optic-clp does not have the full functionality of OPTIC available,
it does not function well in problems with Preferences, and the TIL abstraction
functionality may not work reliably.  It is nonetheless useful as in the
absence of these, it is generally faster than optic-cplex.

For further details of TIL abstraction, see "Automated  Planning for Liner 
Shipping Fleet Repositioning", K. Tierney, A. J. Coles, A. I. Coles, C. Kroer,
A. Britt, and R. M. Jensen, ICAPS 2012.

Running
-------

optic-clp domain.pddl problem.pddl

This runs OPTIC on the given domain and problem file, carrying on search
after the first solution in an attempt to optimise quality. If you want to
ignore solution costs and stop after the first solution, run:

optic-clp -N domain.pddl problem.pddl

Or, if you have an upper-bound on plan cost, run:

optic-clp -n<bound> domain.pddl problem.pddl

If you wish to insist that each solution has to be at least 10 better than
the last found, run:

optic-clp '->10' domain.pddl problem.pddl

Note that the planner does not, itself, limit its time and/or memory usage.
Apply these by using the relevant shell commands beforehand, e.g.:

bash
ulimit -t 1800
ulimit -v 4000000
./optic-clp domain.pddl problem.pddl


...will limit the planner to 30 minutes of CPU and 4GiB of memory.


Feedback
--------

If you do something exciting with OPTIC, do let us know.  If you tried to do 
something with it, but it failed, you may have found a bug.  In common with
POPF, the three most likely sources of bugs are:

The three most common causes of bugs (over 90% of bug reports) are:

- Using ADL. ADL is supported in the conditions of preferences, in the
  time-dependent costs of goal-collection actions, and one or two other niche
  cases.  We've attempted to make the planner degrade gracefully, but there are
  still cases where it will report problems using ADL as being unsolvable.
  Check there are no negative preconditions in your domain.
  
- Domain modelling bugs. OPTIC and POPF support the full start--end semantics
  of PDDL 2.1, and self-overlapping actions, so errors in the temporal
  placement of preconditions and effects (at start, at end etc.) are more
  likely to cause issues with POPF than with other planners. For instance, if
  a 'move' action is written (erroneously) as deleting the old location at the
  end (rather than at the start), then POPF will consider concurrent move 
  actions for the same vehicle; whereas planners which do not make as clear a 
  distinction between the start and end-points of durative actions would not 
  consider this. Thus, in domains with errors such as this, POPF might have to
  consider a far larger search space than other temporal planners.

- If the plans don't validate, ensure you are passing the '-t 0.001' flag to
  VAL: the planner uses an epsilon value of 0.001, smaller than the default
  0.01 value used in VAL.

If none of those apply, email as small a possible domain and problem file
that cause the error you're observing to Andrew Coles:
